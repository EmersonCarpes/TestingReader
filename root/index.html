                            The forgiveness of our sins implies two phases in Jesus’ mediation in the two apartments of the heavenly sanctuary. First, Jesus removed our sins and carried them Himself on the cross in order to provide
                            forgiveness to everyone who believes in Him <em>(<a class="verse" verse="Acts238,Acts531">Acts 2:38, Acts 5:31</a>)</em>. On the cross, Jesus won the right to forgive anyone who believes in Him because He has
                            carried their sin. He also has inaugurated a new covenant, which allows Him to put God’s law in the heart of believers through the Holy Spirit (
                            <a class="verse" verse="Heb810-Heb812,Ezek3625-Ezek3627">Heb. 8:10–12, Ezek. 36:25–27</a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A second phase in the ministry of Jesus consists of a judgment, the pre-Advent judgment, which was still future from the point of view of Hebrews (
                            <a class="verse" verse="Heb21-Heb24,Heb62,Heb927-Heb928,Heb1025">Heb. 2:1–4; Heb. 6:2; Heb. 9:27, 28; Heb. 10:25</a>). This judgment begins with God’s people and is described in
                            <a class="verse" verse="Dan79-Dan727,Matt221-Matt2214,Rev147">Daniel 7:9–27, Matthew 22:1–14, and Revelation 14:7</a>. Its purpose is to show the righteousness of God in forgiving His people. In this judgment,
                            the records of their lives will be open for the universe to see. God will show what happened in the hearts of believers and how they embraced Jesus as their Savior and accepted His Spirit in their lives.

                            Speaking of this judgment, Ellen G. White wrote: “Man cannot meet these charges himself. In his sin-stained garments, confessing his guilt, he stands before God. But Jesus our Advocate presents an effectual plea
                            in behalf of all who by repentance and faith have committed the keeping of their souls to Him. He pleads their cause and vanquishes their accuser by the mighty arguments of Calvary. His perfect obedience to God’s
                            law, even unto the death of the cross, has given Him all power in heaven and in earth, and He claims of His Father mercy and reconciliation for guilty man. . . . But while we should realize our sinful condition,
                            we are to rely upon Christ as our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. We cannot answer the charges of Satan against us. Christ alone can make an effectual plea in our behalf. He is able to
                            silence the accuser with arguments founded not upon our merits, but on His own.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 471, 472.

                                    Christ humbled Himself to stand at the head of humanity, to meet the temptations and endure the trials that humanity must meet and endure. He must know what humanity has to meet from the fallen foe, that
                                    He might know how to succor those who are tempted.<br />
                                    And Christ has been made our Judge. The Father is not the Judge. The angels are not. He who took humanity upon Himself, and in this world lived a perfect life, is to judge us. He only can be our Judge.
                                    Will you remember this, brethren? Will you remember it, ministers? Will you remember it, fathers and mothers? Christ took humanity that He might be our Judge. No one of you has been appointed to be a
                                    judge of others. It is all that you can do to discipline yourselves. In the name of Christ I entreat you to heed the injunction that He gives you never to place yourselves on the judgment seat. From day
                                    to day this message has been sounded in my ears: “Come down from the judgment seat. Come down in humility.”—<em>Testimonies for the Church</em>, vol. 9, pp. 185, 186.

                                    “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” Here is language that expresses His mind toward a corrupt and idolatrous people: “How
                                    shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? . . . Mine heart is turned within Me, My repentings are kindled together.” Must He give up the people for whom such a provision has been
                                    made, even His only-begotten Son, the express image of Himself? God permits His Son to be delivered up for our offenses. He Himself assumes toward the Sin Bearer the character of a judge, divesting
                                    Himself of the endearing qualities of a father.<br />
                                    Herein His love commends itself in the most marvelous manner to the rebellious race. What a sight for angels to behold! What a hope for man, “that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us”! The just
                                    suffered for the unjust; He bore our sins in His own body on the tree. “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”—
                                    <em>Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers</em>, pp. 245, 246.

                                    We need to have higher and more distinct views of the character of Christ. . . . We are not to think of God only as a judge and to forget Him as a loving Father. Nothing can do our souls greater harm than
                                    this, for our whole spiritual life is molded from our conceptions of God’s character. We have lessons to learn of Jesus’ love.<br />
                                    “Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.”
                                    <a class="verse" verse="Eph51-Eph52">Ephesians 5:1, 2</a>. This is the height of the love we are required to reach. And the texture of this love is not tainted with selfishness.—<em>Our High Calling</em>,
